= Buttons Library for Arduino =

Buttons.h lib - a non-blocking smart input library that supports:
single-press, multi-press, long-press, pulse-press and de-bouncing.

This code (Buttons.h & Buttons.cpp) defines 3 classes:
Buttons - the basic class - handles multiple buttons easily.
Keypad - inherits from Buttons, handle a matrix buttons keypad easily.
Joystick - inherits from Buttons, handle 1 axis or 2 axes analog joystick.

See the the included examples for more information,
and even take a look at the source files - my favorite option..!

I attached images of all the electronics schematics and modules pinouts!
