= Buttons Library for Arduino =

Buttons.h lib - a non-blocking smart input library that supports:<br>
single-press, multi-press, long-press, pulse-press and de-bouncing.<br>

This code (Buttons.h & Buttons.cpp) defines 3 classes:<br>
Buttons - the basic class - handles multiple buttons easily.<br>
Keypad - inherits from Buttons, handle a matrix buttons keypad easily.<br>
Joystick - inherits from Buttons, handle 1 axis or 2 axes analog joystick.<br>

See the the included examples for more information,<br>
and even take a look at the source files - my favorite option..!<br>

I attached images of all the electronics schematics and modules pinouts!<br>
